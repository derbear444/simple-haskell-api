# Simple Haskell API

## Description

A Haskell project developed for a CS-3490 final. This simple Haskell program accepts a user-specified URI, and allows them to do certain operations.

## Features

Currently, the program only supports GET and POST requests, but could be extended to support any needed request method.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/wilsondc5/simple-haskell-api.git`)
2. Navigate to the directory (`cd simple-haskell-api`)
3. Run `cabal build` and then `cabal run`

## Uses

- Cabal v. 3.6.2.0
- GHC v. 8.10.7

## Testing
